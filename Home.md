Welcome to the TinyG wiki!

Well, sort of. We are actually keeping a documentation wiki here: [Synthetos TinyG Wiki](http://www.synthetos.com/wiki/index.php?title=Projects:TinyG)<br>
This is effectively the user manual. We (Synthetos) maintain it - i.e. it's not an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff, feel free to do it here in the github wiki.

There is a support forum here: [Synthetos Forums](http://www.synthetos.com/forums/)<br>
The forum is for general questions about how to setup and use tinyg (and grblshield). Sometimes the questions end up in the github issues list, but generally they do not. Feel free to post issues to the github issues as you see fit. More people read the forum than the issues, so if you are looking for help the forum is probably a better choice.

Someone once called our forum "moribund". I take this as a compliment because with as many boards as we've shipped the fact that so few issues show up on the forum is a good thing, not a bad thing.

There is also a google group about TinyG development over here: [TinyG Development Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/devTinyG)<br>
This is a conversation about new development, options, related products like controllers and android tablets, etc.
