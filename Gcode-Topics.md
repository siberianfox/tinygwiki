##Coordinate Systems and Offsets
TinyG supports the following coordinate systems, offsets and positioning commands that are all related. More detail later, but here they are:

* G53 - Absolute coordinate system (aka machine coordinate system)
* G54 - Coordinate system 1 - set offsets using G10 L2 P1 X...
* G55 - Coordinate system 2 - set offsets using G10 L2 P2 X...
* G56 - Coordinate system 3 - set offsets using G10 L2 P3 X...
* G57 - Coordinate system 4 - set offsets using G10 L2 P4 X...
* G58 - Coordinate system 5 - set offsets using G10 L2 P5 X...
* G59 - Coordinate system 6 - set offsets using G10 L2 P6 X...
* G92 - Temporary offsets
* G28/G28.1 - Save absolute position (G28.1) and return to saved position (G28)

The coordinate systems and their offsets can be viewed in layers. The bottom layer is the **absolute** coordinate system aka **machine** coordinate system. This is always the G53 coor
