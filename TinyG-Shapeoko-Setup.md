This page provides and example setup for a reasonably well tuned 3 axis or 4 axis Shapeoko with 375mm slides. Depending on your mechanics you may need to change values, but this should offer a reasonable starting point. Please see the [TinyG Tuning Page](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki/TinyG-Tuning) for some details about tuning up the machine.

The general settings are listed below. See also [extensions for dual Y motor setups]

Settings use the following format by way of example:

  $jd=0.01<br>
  $xvm=16000<br>

All settings are in mm, so be sure you are in mm mode. If in doubt enter  G21 at the command line.

For details of the settings see the [TinyG Configuration Page](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki/TinyG-Configuration)

## System Settings
	setting | value | description |notes
	---------|---------|---------|-------
	$ja | 2000000 | JUNCTION_ACCELERATION | 2 million - centripetal acceleration around corners
	$st | 1 | SWITCH_TYPE | 0=normally open, 1=normally closed. Use NC for better noise immunity 

## Motor Settings
###Motor 1
	setting | value | description |notes
	---------|---------|---------|-------
	$1ma | 0 | MOTOR_MAP | map motor 1 to X axis (0=X, 1=Y, 2=Z, 3=A, 4=B, 5=C)
	$1sa | 1.8 | STEP_ANGLE | set 1.8 degrees for 200 step motors, 0.9 for 400 step motors
	$1tr | 36.54 | TRAVEL_PER_REV | Amount X moves in 1 motor revolution. Your setup may be slightly different.

	$1po | 0 | POLARITY | Depends on how you wired your motors 
	$1pm | 0 | POWER_MODE | 0 leaves steppers on if anything moves. Good for belt machines like Shapeoko 

###Motor 2
	setting | value | description |notes
	---------|---------|---------|-------
	$2ma | 1 | MOTOR_MAP | map motor 2 to Y axis (0=X, 1=Y, 2=Z, 3=A, 4=B, 5=C)
	$2sa | 1.8 | STEP_ANGLE | set 1.8 degrees for 200 step motors, 0.9 for 400 step motors
	$2tr | 36.54 | TRAVEL_PER_REV | Amount Y moves in 1 revolution
	$2mi | 8 | MICROSTEPS | Supported values are 1, 2, 4 and 8
	$2po | 0 | POLARITY | Depends on how you wired your motors

###Motor 3
	setting | value | description |notes
	---------|---------|---------|-------
	$3ma | 2 | MOTOR_MAP | map motor 3 to Z axis (0=X, 1=Y, 2=Z, 3=A, 4=B, 5=C)
	$3sa | 1.8 | STEP_ANGLE | set 1.8 degrees for 200 step motors, 0.9 for 400 step motors
	$3tr | 1.25 | TRAVEL_PER_REV | Amount Z moves in 1 revolution
	$3mi | 4 | MICROSTEPS | Supported values are 1, 2, 4 and 8
	$3po | 0 | POLARITY | Depends on how you wired your motors 
	$3pm | 0 | POWER_MODE | 0 leaves steppers on if anything moves

###Motor 4
	setting | value | description |notes
	---------|---------|---------|-------
	$4ma | 1 | MOTOR_MAP | map motor 4 to second Y axis (0=X, 1=Y, 2=Z, 3=A, 4=B, 5=C)
	$4sa | 1.8 | STEP_ANGLE | set 1.8 degrees for 200 step motors, 0.9 for 400 step motors
	$4tr | 36.54 | TRAVEL_PER_REV | Amount Y moves in 1 motor revolution
	$4mi | 8 | MICROSTEPS | Supported values are 1, 2, 4 and 8
	$4po | 1 | POLARITY | Reverse from Motor 2 so it doesn't fight motor 2's Y. 
	$4pm | 0 | POWER_MODE | 0 leaves steppers on if anything moves

Note on polarity. X should move right for positive moves. Y should move away from the front of the table for positive moves. Z should move up for positive moves. Reverse polarity of the axis if this is not true. 

Dual gantry setups: Map motor 4 to the Y axis and set everything else up the same. Set polarity so the motors are not fighting each other.
