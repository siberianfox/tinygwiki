###Intro
Shopeoko and TinyG are a great fit. The combination make a good upgrade to support very smooth, fast motor operation, built-in support for dual Y axis configurations, and other enhancements. 

###What Do I get?
Motion control is very smooth due to precise timing and constant jerk acceleration. This means a number of things to the Shapeoko user. TinyG has an optimized, low jitter step generation coupled with constant jerk acceleration management. As a result TinyG gets a lot out of your motors. If you think you need to upgrade from the stock NEMA17 motors to something larger you may find that more precise control offered by TinyG is really all you need.

The constant jerk acceleration management also makes for extremely fast rapids (traverses), which helps cut down job times. It does all this with minimal shaking of the machine and toolhead, making for smoother cuts with less change of skipping, chattering, or other artifacts.

###Tgfx
TinyG works with tgfx, a cross-platform control program available for Mac, Windows and Linux.
