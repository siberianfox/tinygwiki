## Intent
The tinyg2 **project** is a motion control **application** built on a set of underlying **components**. We want the licensing to reflect this, and to treat using the application as a whole somewhat differently than using the components as a library. The intent of the tinyg2 licensing scheme is summarized as:
* Ensure that the tinyg2 project remains open source
* Encourage contribution to the project and ensure that most changes and enhancements are returned to the community
* Make it easy to use tinyg2 components in free and commercial projects/products- i.e. encourage use of tinyg2 components as a library
* Notwithstanding the above, make the application when used as a whole retain GPLv2 copyleft and other provisions 

tinyg2 licensing is based on GPLv2 with the [BeRTOS extension](http://www.bertos.org/discover/license) to enable using component files without invoking GPL copyleft. To this end, all files in the project are licensed under GPLv2. Those files that are considered "components" carry the BeRTOS exception, that allows their use without opening source code that they come in contact with. 

tinyg2 also includes [Motate](https://github.com/giseburt/Motate) hardware abstraction components that are licensed under the same scheme. 

Most of what follows is shamelessly cribbed from the BeRTOS site.

## Info
###You are free to...
* Include tinyg2 components within any product, distributed under any license, including commercial licenses and/or closed-source licenses
* Modify tinyg2 components as you want under the following conditions:
 * Attribution - You must declare in a written statement in documentation and source code that you are using tinyg2 components in your application and offer to provide the (possibly modified) tinyg2 source code
 * Share-alike - If you modify tinyg2 components, you may distribute them only under the original license
 * Contribution - If you modify tinyg2 components, you must contribute the modifications back to the tinyg2 project

###What you can do with tinyg2 components...
If you are a company or individual doing commercial embedded products, you can:
* Download and use tinyg2 components as you want
* Sell products based on tinyg2 components without paying royalties or other fees
* Sell products based on tinyg2 components without opening or giving away your other application source code

###What you must do with tinyg2 components...
If you sell or otherwise distribute code/products that use tinyg2 components you must:
* Provide attribution that you are using tinyg2 components in the documentation and source code. Text like this is sufficient:
<pre>
"This product uses tinyg2 components (http://www.synthetos.com), Copyright 2013"
