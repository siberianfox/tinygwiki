Most of the time, mills and CNC electrical components are designed and built to minimize electrical noise generated by they generate and re-introduce into the total milling circuitry. In some cases, however, as is the case with some components that can be bought from overseas suppliers, there is a significant amount of electrical noise generated when operating the mill. This noise can be radiated from the device and picked up by USB cabling, power wiring, and traces on circuit boards, or can simply be transmitted back through any wiring connected to the device to other connected devices. When this happens, you run the risk of this electrical noise interfering with normal communications and command execution for your mill, which can lead to communication ports locking up, odd movements, or skipped commands.
