This page is a random collection of notes on building test jigs. Mostly it's a record of mistakes to be avoided.

## Making the pogo board
* Use socketed pogo pins (exclusively). IDI on Mouser. Expensive but worth it
* Use IDI Size 3 preferentially - 0.125" centers
  * R-3-SC sockets
  * S-3-H-4-G waffle head
  * S-3-A-4-G cup head
  * S-3-B-7-G spear
* Use 0.100" only for those things that require this spacing
  * R-100-SC
