Welcome to the TinyG wiki!

Well, sort of. We are actually keeping a documentation wiki over here:<br>
http://www.synthetos.com/wiki/index.php?title=Projects:TinyG<br>
This is effectively the "user manual". We (Synthetos) maintain it - i.e. it's not an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff, feel free to do it here in the github wiki.

There is a support forum here: <br>
http://www.synthetos.com/forums/<br>
This is general questions about how to use tinyg (and grblshield). Sometimes the questions end up in the github issues list, but generally they do not. Feel free to post issues to the github issues as you see fit. More people read the forum than the issues, so if you are looking for help the forum is probably a better choice.

There is also a google group about TinyG development over here:<br>
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/devTinyG<br>
This is a conversation about new development, options, related products like controllers and android tablets, etc.

Please come visit / join any or all of the above.
