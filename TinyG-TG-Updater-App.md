#TinyG Updater App
The TG Updater App is a full on gui application that allows you to update your TinyG v6-v8 (no v9 support at this time) firmware with minimal effort on your part.

Here is the following steps required:
1. Download the updater app for your platform (Windows and OSX are the only ones supported at this time)
2. Plug in your TinyG and make sure that it is not being used by any other application (coolterm, chilipeppr etc.)
3.  Select your TinyG by clicking the radio button next to your TinyG's name.
