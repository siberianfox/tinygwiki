This page discusses how to test TinyG to make sure everything is working properly.
_(Obviously this page is still in work)_

You can use the built-in tests to check that TinyG is working properly. Type $test for a list of tests.

$test=1 is the basic test that will show if the motors and output bits are running. This test is pest performed with motors that are not installed in a machine. Other tests are for installed machines.

From here you may want to look at

* [TinyG Tuning](TinyG-Tuning)
