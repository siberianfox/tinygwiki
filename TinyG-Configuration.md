This page describes how configuration works in text mode from the [Command Line](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki/TinyG-Command-Line). All configs on this page are also accessible in [JSON mode](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki/JSON-Operation). Well almost. Those few commands that apply to only one mode or the other are noted.

Go to one of the following pages for configuration for your firmware version. You can find out the firmware version by entering $fv or by looking at the console output when you hit reset.

* [Configuration for Version 0.97](TinyG-Configuration-for-Firmware-Version-0.97)
* [Configuration for Version 0.96](TinyG-Configuration-for-Firmware-Version-0.96)
* [Configuration for Version 0.95](TinyG-Configuration-for-Firmware-Version-0.95) 
* [Configuration for Version 0.94](TinyG-Configuration-for-Firmware-Version-0.94)
