_As of 6/9/14 - We are updating the wiki to accommodate github's new and "improved" right hand navigation panel, and in general to clean up a bit. There may be some broken links until this process is complete. The actual pages can all be found in the right hand nav --->, but you will have to hunt for them. Thanks for your patience._

Welcome to the TinyG wiki!

This wiki is used to keep documentation from version 0.95 onward. Documentation for previous versions - 0.94 and earlier - can also be found on this site. See the intro sections on various pages for the links.

This wiki is the TinyG user and programmer manual. We (Synthetos) maintain it, but it's an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff, feel free to do it here. Please let us know via a github Issue if it's anything major. Issues are good for requested changes, discussions and bona-fide software bugs.

For general support use the [Synthetos Forums](https://www.synthetos.com/forum/tinyg/)
The forum is for general questions about how to setup and use tinyg (and gShield). Sometimes the questions end up in the github issues list, but generally they do not. Feel free to post github issues as you see fit, but more people read the forum than the issues, so if you are looking for help the forum is probably a better choice.

There is also a [TinyG Development Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/devTinyG). This is a conversation about new development, options, related products like controllers and android tablets, etc.

Please come visit / join any or all of the above.
