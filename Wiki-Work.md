This page contains nots for things that should be done to clean up the wiki.

###Communicating with TinyG
This whole area is a mess. We need:
- A page on the proper use of Linemode transmission protocol. 
- Related pages: Incorporate any useful data, possibly get rid of:
  - [Flow-Control-and-Footers](Flow-Control-and-Footers)
  - [Sending-Data-to-TinyG-using-RX-Packet-Mode](Sending-Data-to-TinyG-using-RX-Packet-Mode)
  - [TinyG-Boot-Loader](TinyG-Boot-Loader) May be a child page of something else.
  - [Tinyg-Communications-Programming](Tinyg-Communications-Programming) Useful background, but flow control is all wrong

###Updating Firmware and Problems with Flashing
These pages should be reviewed so they hold together under one "Updating Firmware" or "Flashing TinyG" page. These might be just fine the way they are, I'm not sure.
- [TinyG-Updating-Firmware](TinyG-Updating-Firmware) Parent page. Linked from sidebar
- [TinyG-TG-Updater-App](TinyG-TG-Updater-App) Child page
- [SpDir-Continues-To-Flash-Error](SpDir-Continues-To-Flash-Error) related page
- [Firmware-Update-Verification-Failure](Firmware-Update-Verification-Failure) related page
- [Programming-TinyG-with-an-External-Programmer](Programming-TinyG-with-an-External-Programmer) Outdated?
- []()
- []()

###Troubleshooting
Riley has created some good pages around flashing problems. THese need to reside unde Troubleshooting. Perhapos we need

### Pages that should be reviewed and revised

- [TinyG-Developer-Notes](TinyG-Developer-Notes)
- [Dual-Gantry-Configuration](Dual-Gantry-Configuration) Superseded by the Shapeoko page
- [Probing-Description-and-Operation](Probing-Description-and-Operation) is blank
