Welcome to the TinyG wiki!

Well, sort of. We are actually keeping a documentation wiki over here:
http://www.synthetos.com/wiki/index.php?title=Projects:TinyG
This is effectively the "user manual" we maintain it - i.e. it's not an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff, feel free to do it here in the github wiki

There is a support forum here:
http://www.synthetos.com/forums/
This is for people who have questions about how to use tinyg (and grblshield). Sometimes their questions end up in the github issues list, but generally they do not.

There is also a google group about TinyG development over here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/devTinyG
This is a conversation about new development, options, related products like controllers and android tablets, etc.

Please come visit / join any or all of the above.
