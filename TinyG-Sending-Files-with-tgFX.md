## Gotchas
There are a few things to make sure before you send your file.
* Make sure your toolhead is homed (or placed where you think it should be) and your axis are zeroed.
* Make sure that you have your machine in the right Unit mode.  (Inches or MM) Or make sure your gcode file has G20 or G21 in it.
* If you are setting your machines position by "right click set machine position" then make sure your file does not have a m3 at end of the program.
* Pausing, Stopping, Reset actions are not automatic. There is at times a lag.  Remove the power supply in an emergency.
